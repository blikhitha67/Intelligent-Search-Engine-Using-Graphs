**Dataset Source:**  
- Documents were collected from **Kaggle**, including cybersecurity articles, threat reports, and technical documentation.  
- Data was preprocessed to simulate a realistic mini search engine environment.

**Data Analysis Performed:**  
- **Document Length Distribution:** Most documents ranged between **200–1000 words**, providing sufficient content for meaningful similarity analysis.  
- **Keyword Analysis:** Frequent keywords included `Python`, `AI`, `cybersecurity`, `machine learning`, `threat`, `network`. These keywords guided graph creation and relevance scoring.  
- **Document Similarity:** Cosine similarity computed among documents identified clusters with overlapping content, forming edges in the document graph.  
- **Graph Structure Insights:** Central documents with high PageRank scores were found in clusters, showing relevance across multiple topics.

**Purpose:**  
- Ensures the dataset is **diverse and meaningful** for testing the intelligent search engine.  
- Demonstrates that **preprocessing and similarity scoring** are working as intended before deploying search queries.
